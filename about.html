     <H2>Bio</H2>
       <p>My name is Noe Vivar. I'm a student at EWU. Currently a junior who is majoring in VCD or Visual Communication Design, with a minor in art. I have so much experience in so many things that I wont be able to list them all. So instead I will just list out the things I'm the best at. Some of these things would include playing video games, eating, procrastinating, as well as some design experiance but there is always room for growth. </p>

        <h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
       <h3>What I Want to Accomplish</h3>
       <p>I want to gain as much knowledge as I can from the class and put as much of it to use. I may struggle a bit along the way only due to learning something new. Although this will not deteriorate me from wanting to learn and improve. It took me a while to get use to Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustrator adn InDesign, but I feel like I have improved so much from when I began.</p>
